# Deployment Fixes and Project Review

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Dependency Conflicts
**Problem**: The deployment was failing due to version conflicts between Next.js and next-sanity packages.

**Root Cause**: 
- `next-sanity@10.0.2` requires Next.js 15.1+
- Project was using Next.js 14.2.3
- ESLint config was also mismatched

**Solutions Applied**:
- Downgraded `next-sanity` from `^10.0.2` to `^9.4.7` (compatible with Next.js 14.2.3)
- Downgraded `eslint-config-next` from `15.3.5` to `14.2.3`
- Downgraded `@types/react` from `19.1.8` to `^18.3.0` (compatible with React 18)
- Downgraded Tailwind CSS packages to more stable versions
- Added `.npmrc` file with `legacy-peer-deps=true` to handle remaining peer dependency issues

### 2. Package.json Updates
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "14.2.3",
    "next-sanity": "^9.4.7",
    "react": "^18",
    "react-dom": "^18"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/react": "^18.3.0",
    "eslint-config-next": "14.2.3",
    "@tailwindcss/postcss": "^4.0.0",
    "tailwindcss": "^4.0.0"
  }
}
```

### 3. Added .npmrc Configuration
```
legacy-peer-deps=true
auto-install-peers=true
```
